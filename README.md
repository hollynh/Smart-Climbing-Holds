# Smart-Climbing-Holds

This code is to be used with RFM69HCW transceivers that are connected to Arduino Unos or Redboards. All wiring instructions are included in the actual code in comment formats within the headers. This code allows the transcievers to send and recieve signals, to addressed transceivers, that will cause an LED and Piezo buzzer to be enabled.
